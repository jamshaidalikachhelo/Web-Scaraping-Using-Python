What is Solitaire?
Solitaire is the collective term for hundreds of card games and activities requiring only one person. The game involves arranging a shuffled deck of cards into a specified order or tableau, no matter the variation.
The origins of the game are a little hazy. One of the first documented references to the word "solitaire" was in a 17th-century engraving featuring Anne-Joulie de Rohan-Chabot, Princess Soubise, playing solitaire. However, this was a different game as it used pegs instead of cards.
The card game Solitaire likely originated from cartomancy or tarot as an early form of fortune telling due to how cards are laid out in both practices. This is also supported by the use of the alternative term "cabale", which originated from the Medieval Latin "caballa", meaning secret knowledge.
Some game variations have also been called patience, especially in England, Germany, and Portugal. Queen Victoria's German husband, Prince Albert, was notably fond of patience games.

How to Play Solitaire
Classic Solitaire, also known as klondike solitaire, is arguably the most popular form of solitaire today. Moreover, it's the version you can find on nearly every Microsoft computer since 1990, further cementing its place in modern culture. 
You will need a standard deck to play a classic klondike game. The goal is to build the four suits into a foundation of aces.

After shuffling, here's how you play:

Deal 28 cards in seven piles across your table. The first pile would have one card; the second one would have two; the third pile would have three, and so on. The top card on each pile stays facing up, while the others are face-down cards. The rest of the cards will rest on a stock pile in your upper left hand.

The four aces in the deck will serve as the foundations that you place in a row above your initial 28 cards as soon as they become available.

You can place any movable card on another one that is higher in rank and with the opposite color. For example, you can play a red four on a black five. If more than one card is face up on a pile, you can move them together.
If there is an empty space on the tableau, only a king can fill it.
The player may use the cards on the stock pile to help them build sequences.
You win after all  the card are placed in the foundation.

3 Tips and Reminders for Winning at Solitaire

One of the best ways to improve your solitaire-playing skills is by educating yourself about gameplay strategies.

1. Think Ahead
Be mindful about each action you take. Some moves could become irreversible, making you unable to continue the game, so think about possible consequences or outcomes for each move you make. The most crucial thing is to take your time and never rush. Do you remember? Solitaire is all about patience.

2. Work on Larger Stacks First
Revealing the cards in stacks or columns will give you better chances of getting cards that could help you out when building your sequences.

3. Play Aces and Twos Immediately
They don't usually help reveal hidden cards, either, so it's best to set them aside as soon as possible.

FAQs on How to Play Solitaire
1. How many versions of Solitaire are there?
There are over 500 variations of Solitaire. However, more versions could be invented due to the game's simplicity and the many rule combinations one could make.

2. Is Solitaire easy to learn?
The rules of solitaire are pretty simple to understand, especially if one already has experience playing card games. Developing a winning strategy is the more challenging part.

3. Is it possible to win every game of Solitaire that you play?
The short answer is no. Some variations could be easier to win than others. Still, it's improbable that every game of solitaire could be winnable, especially considering the randomness of the cards and the sensitivity of each move.
